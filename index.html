   <h1>What It's All About</h1>

   <p>Whence come the thousands of photographs used evsry month by newspapers and magazines?</p>

   <p>More than that,whence do the photographs come which are used by makers of calendars,postcards,for advertisements,and for illustrating books,stories and articles?</p>

   <blockquote>
      <p>This little book is a practical, up-to-the-minute answer to the question: "How can I make my camera-work profitable?" </p>

      <cite>A.H.Beardsley, <br> Publisher, Photo-Extra Magazine.</cite> 
      <p>At first i thought, the answer is, "From professional photographers and publisher-photo-services."But proffessional do not produce one-third of the photographs used, and publisher-photo-services are supplied by that same large number of camerists that supply publications with most of thei prints.</p>

      <p>Is the field overcrowded? <em>No.</em> I f there were ten times as many persons engaged in the work they could all keep themselves busy.</p>

      <p>The markets may be described briefly:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Newspapers</li>
         <li>Magazines</li>
         <li>Postcard-makers</li>
         <li>Calendar-makers</li>
         <li>Art-study producers</li>
         <li>Illustration for books</li>
         <li>Illustration for articles</li>
         <li>Prints for advertising.</li>
       
        
      </ol>
